# Phase 5: Integration & Production Hardening

**Status:** Not Started
**Expected Start:** Week 5-6
**Expected Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Goal:** Production-ready release

---

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on integration, testing, performance optimization, and production readiness rather than new features.

---

## Objectives

1. Unified validation pipeline (all phases integrated)
2. Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
3. Performance optimization
4. Enhanced error handling
5. Production deployment preparation
6. Documentation finalization

---

## Technical Approach

### Testing
- Unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Regression test suite
- Performance benchmarks
- Accuracy measurement framework

### Optimization
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Optimize image processing pipeline
- Cache frequently-used data
- Parallel processing where possible

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- Informative error messages
- Recovery mechanisms
- Logging improvements

---

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 complete
- Selected phases from 2-4 complete
- Overall accuracy target achieved (≥80%)

---

## Planned Deliverables

### Code
- Complete test suite (`tests/` directory)
- Continuous integration setup
- Performance profiling results
- Optimization improvements

### Documentation
- Production deployment guide
- Troubleshooting manual
- API documentation
- User training materials

### Infrastructure
- Automated testing pipeline
- Version management
- Release notes template
- Bug tracking workflow

---

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit tests:** ≥80% code coverage
- **Integration tests:** All major workflows
- **Regression tests:** All known issues
- **Performance tests:** Benchmark suite
