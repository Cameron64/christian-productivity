## Access Strategy

### Recommended Workflow for Christian:

#### Option 1: Web-Based Lookups (Current Best Option)
**For regular reference:**
1. Bookmark key Municode pages:
   - Drainage Criteria Manual: https://library.municode.com/tx/austin/codes/drainage_criteria_manual
   - Transportation Criteria Manual: https://library.municode.com/tx/austin/codes/transportation_criteria_manual
   - Title 30: https://library.municode.com/tx/austin/codes/land_development_code (navigate to Title 30)
   - Title 25 Chapter 25-6: http://austin-tx.elaws.us/code/ldc_title25_ch25-6

2. Use built-in search functionality for specific terms
3. Navigate hierarchical structure when browsing

**Pros:**
✅ Always current
✅ No downloads needed
✅ Built-in search

**Cons:**
❌ Requires internet
❌ No offline access
❌ Slower for repeated lookups

---

#### Option 2: Download Critical Sections as PDFs
**For offline reference:**

1. **Identify most-used sections** (track what you reference most often)
2. **Download PDFs from Municode:**
   - Navigate to specific section
   - Use browser print → Save as PDF
   - Or use Municode's PDF export if available
3. **Organize locally:**
   ```
   documents/
   ├── drainage/
   │   ├── DCM-Section-1-Drainage-Policy.pdf
   │   ├── DCM-Section-5-Storm-Drains.pdf
   │   └── DCM-Section-6-Open-Channels.pdf
   ├── transportation/
   │   ├── TCM-Street-Standards.pdf
   │   ├── TCM-ROW-Requirements.pdf
   │   └── LDC-25-6-Parking.pdf
   └── subdivision/
       ├── Title-30-Overview.pdf
       └── Title-30-Ch30-5-Environment.pdf
   ```
4. **Use PDF Processing Pro skill** to:
   - Extract text for searching
   - Create searchable index
   - Build custom reference database

**Pros:**
✅ Offline access
✅ Fast lookups
✅ Can annotate/highlight
✅ No internet required

**Cons:**
❌ May become outdated
❌ Manual download effort
❌ Need to track updates

---

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Best of both worlds:**

1. **Keep critical sections as PDFs** (Option 2)
   - Download top 10-15 most-used sections
   - Store in organized folder structure
   - Update quarterly or when notified of changes

2. **Use web for everything else** (Option 1)
   - Bookmarked for quick access
   - Always get latest updates
   - Good for occasional lookups

3. **Build a quick reference guide**
   - Create searchable index of downloaded PDFs
   - Maintain list of bookmarks by topic
   - Track which codes apply to which scenarios

---

## Upcoming: Intelligent Code Lookup Tool

### Proposed Tool Features:
1. **Local PDF cache** of frequently-used sections
2. **Full-text search** across all cached documents
3. **Smart lookup** - Ask questions in plain language
4. **Cross-reference** - Automatically link related sections
5. **Update notifications** - Track when codes change
6. **Bookmark management** - Quick access to web versions

### Implementation Plan:
- Use PDF Processing Pro skill for text extraction
- Build SQLite database for full-text search
- Create simple CLI or web interface
- Integrate web scraping for updates (if needed)

## Most Common Lookups (Track Your Usage)

Create a tracking list of your most frequent lookups:

| Topic | Code Section | Manual | Frequency |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Storm drain sizing | DCM Section 5 | Drainage Criteria Manual | |
| ROW width - local street | TCM Chapter X | Transportation Criteria Manual | |
| Minimum parking spaces | LDC 25-6-XXX | Land Development Code | |
| Floodplain regulations | LDC 25-7-33 | Land Development Code | |
| Erosion control | DCM Section X | Drainage Criteria Manual | |

**Instructions:** Track each lookup for 2-4 weeks, then prioritize downloading the top 10-15 most-used sections.

---

## Update Tracking

### How to Stay Current:

1. **Subscribe to Code Updates:**
   - Check if Austin offers email notifications for code changes
   - Monitor City Council agendas for ordinance amendments

2. **Quarterly Review:**
   - Every 3 months, check Municode for updates to critical sections
   - Re-download any updated PDFs

3. **Version Control:**
   - Add effective date to PDF filenames: `DCM-Section-5-Storm-Drains-2024-01-15.pdf`
   - Keep previous version in archive folder if major changes

---

## Questions to Answer for Tool Development

1. **Which specific sections do you reference most often?**
   - List top 10 code sections by frequency
   - Identify patterns in lookups

2. **What type of information are you typically looking for?**
   - Dimensional standards (widths, depths, etc.)?
   - Calculation methods?
   - Material specifications?
   - Procedural requirements?

3. **How do you currently use the information?**
   - Quick fact-checking during design?
   - Detailed design calculations?
   - Client/review explanations?
   - Compliance verification?

4. **What would make lookups faster/easier?**
   - Faster search?
   - Better organization?
   - Quick reference tables?
   - Comparison tools?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start tracking your code lookups** for 2 weeks
2. **Identify top 10-15 most-used sections**
3. **Download those sections as PDFs** to documents folder
4. **Test PDF Processing Pro** on one section to create searchable text
5. **Decide if we should build the intelligent lookup tool**
